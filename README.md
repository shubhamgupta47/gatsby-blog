  This is my Gatsby Blog Project
</h1>

I was just curious about Gatsby, so thought of building a small blog. So here it is..

## ðŸš€ Quick start ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Just clone the repo and follow the steps to start with the project:

    ```shell
    npm install
    ```

    ```shell
    npm run develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._
